# Repo Manager
### What is this?
Repo manager is a collection of bash scripts designed to be invoked by
git hooks.

These scripts keep the repo configuration files up-to-date and help
distributing formatter configurations and such. Moreover, a self update
mechanism is implemented so once the tools have been invoked there is no
need to ever touch them again except in the origin update location.
