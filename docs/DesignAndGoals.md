# Design and goals

###### Note that this paper is not designed to give you a detailed understanding of how things are implemented, but rather to give you an idea of what we are doing

## Paranoia - Why and how?

### Why?
While the name is rather weird and based on a little story not 
explained here, it kind of stands for a fully open source chat network. 
Basically, we are aiming to create a replacement for Discord and 
possibly other social networks. While doing so, we want to combine the 
best features from all of those and also give the user control over the 
data he shares.


#### What exactly does control mean in this context? 
You always hear about data leaks or companies selling data, may it be 
legal or not. First of all, Paranoia is not a company, but a group of 
people experimenting and having fun writing an application. So we have 
no interest in your data - and as such, we just request what is required 
for the functionality. Currently it is not clear what this will be, but 
probably an email and a nickname.

### How?
Creating a chat network is not an easy task (you don't say...). So what
do we want? As said, combining features and maintaining privacy is the
way to go, at least in our opinion. 

We all know social networks like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. On the
other hand, following a different concept we have networks such as
WhatsApp (yes, its still a network), Skype and Discord, Discord being the
one providing the most features. But none of those networks really care
about privacy (they are profit oriented) and also don't they combine
features from the others.
